    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I’m a <span class="bold">data scientist, software engineer</span>, a creative mind, a critical thinker; I derive honest enjoyment in going beyond 
        the barriers posed by our assumptions and using data as a starting point for exploration and problem-solving.

        I have spent the last two years formally learning this approach and, in the process, graduated 
        Master of Science Data science from the <span class="bold">University of Surrey</span>. Prior to that, I studied IT majoring in 
        Business Intelligence at <span class="bold">Strathmore University</span>.

        I’m currently building disease risk prediction models from a telephone health survey that looks at behavioural 
        risk factors of noninstitutionalised adults. You can check out the project 
        <a class="bold" href="https://github.com/evansochola?tab=repositories">here.</a>
